To understand `this` binding, we have to understand the call-site: the location in code where a function is called
(**not where it's declared**). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's _this_ `this` a reference
to?

What's important is to think about the **call-stack** (the stack of functions that have been called to get us to the
current moment in execution). The call-site we care about is _in_ the invocation _before_ the currently executing
function.

### Let's demonstrate call-stack and call-site:

```js
function baz() {
  // call-stack is: `baz`
  // so, our call-site is in the global scope

  console.log("baz");
  bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
}

function bar() {
  // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
  // so, our call-site is in `baz`

  console.log("bar");
  foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
}

function foo() {
  // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
  // so, our call-site is in `bar`

  console.log("foo");
}

baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
```

Take care when analyzing code to find the actual call-site (from the call-stack), because it's the only thing that
matters for `this` binding.
